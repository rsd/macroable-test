# Laravel Model Relationship Debugging Project

## Objective

This project is set up to demonstrate and debug a specific scenario in Laravel's Eloquent ORM involving relationships between models. The goal is to create a chain of one-to-many relationships (A -> B -> C) and implement a method on the "A" model that allows direct querying of related "C" model records, filtered by a specific parameter, bypassing the intermediate "B" model.

## Model Structure

The project uses the following models:

*   **Company (A):** Represents a company.
*   **Team (B):** Represents a team within a company.  A company has many teams.
*   **Project (C):** Represents a project undertaken by a team. A team has many projects.

The relationships are defined as follows:

*   Company `hasMany` Team
*   Team `belongsTo` Company
*   Team `hasMany` Project
*   Project `belongsTo` Team

## Specific Task

The core task is to implement a method named `projectsByStatus($status)` on the `Company` model. This method should:

1.  Retrieve all `Project` records associated with the `Company` instance.
2.  Filter the retrieved `Project` records based on the provided `$status` parameter (e.g., 'active', 'completed').
3.  Achieve this *without* explicitly traversing the intermediate `Team` model in the method's implementation.  It should use Eloquent's relationship capabilities to directly access the `Project` records.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment:**
    *   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    *   Set your database connection details in the `.env` file (DB\_CONNECTION, DB\_DATABASE, etc.).  The default is SQLite, which requires no further configuration.
    *   Generate an application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```

4.  **Run migrations:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5. **Create the seed:**
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

## Usage (for testing/debugging)

1.  **Use Tinker:** Laravel's Tinker REPL is ideal for interacting with the models and testing the relationships.
    ```bash
    php artisan tinker
    ```

2.  **Example Usage in Tinker:**

    ```php
    // Get the first company.
    $company = App\Models\Company::first();

    // Access projects directly (all projects).
    $allProjects = $company->teams()->with('projects')->get()->pluck('projects')->flatten();
    echo $allProjects;

    // Access projects with a specific status (using the custom method).
    $activeProjects = $company->projectsByStatus('active')->get();
    echo $activeProjects;

    $completedProjects = $company->projectsByStatus('completed')->get();
    echo $completedProjects;
    ```

## Troubleshooting

*   **Database Connection Issues:** Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database credentials.  If using SQLite, make sure the database file exists and is writable.
*   **Migration Errors:** If migrations fail, double-check the migration files for any syntax errors or inconsistencies.
*   **Relationship Errors:** If the relationships aren't working as expected, verify the foreign key definitions in the migrations and the relationship methods (`hasMany`, `belongsTo`) in the models.
*   **`projectsByStatus` Method Not Working:**  Carefully review the implementation of the `projectsByStatus` method in the `Company` model to ensure it correctly uses Eloquent's querying capabilities.
